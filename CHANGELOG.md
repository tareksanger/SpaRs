# Changelog

Release entries are prepared in release pull requests and published after acceptance CI passes for the merged commit.

## Initial release overview

The first release PR must include this overview in its versioned entry before merging:

- Native Rust tokenization and inference for the official English `sm`, `md`, and `lg` 3.8.0 models, referenced against spaCy 3.8.14 and Thinc 8.3.13.
- Explicit native model installation and separate Node.js bindings built from source.
- Model assets acquired separately; no model weights bundled in the Rust crate.
- Experimental API; inference supports only the three English pipelines listed above. See [compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) for supported behavior and remaining limitations.
